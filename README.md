# Spotify Recommendation System
This is my first data science project (done in Spring 2021 alongside 3 other Berkeley data science undergraduate students) which mimicked the popular Spotify "Discover Weekly" algorithm using **linear algebra principles**, foundations of **feature engineering**, and **classification**.

The project was accomplished using the libraries Pandas, NumPy, the Berkeley datascience library, and SpotiPy. 

This project was shaped using these 5 steps:
  1) Setup 
  2) User input
  3) Data cleaning
  4) Creating weight features 
  5) Calculating simlarities between songs using features
  
 ## Parameters
 - 2 Spotify playlists for algorithm to base recommendations off of
